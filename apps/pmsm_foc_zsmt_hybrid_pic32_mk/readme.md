# Sensorless FOC on PMSM using ZS/MT Hybrid Estimator

This example application shows how to control the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) with ZS/MT Hybrid Estimator based Field Oriented Control (FOC) on a PIC32MK Micro-controller. 

## Description

Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) is controlled using Field Oriented Control (FOC). Rotor position and speed is determined using a hybrid estimator with high frequency injection (ZS/MT) for low speed and back EMF observer with PLL estimator for high speed control. Motor start/stop operation is controlled by the switch and motor speed can be changed by the on-board potentiometer. Waveforms and variables can be monitored runtime using X2CScope.

Key features enabled in this project are:

- Dual shunt current measurement
- Speed control loop
- Hybrid ZS/MT

This demonstration project contains dummy libraries for IPD and ZS/MT hybrid and IPD algorithms. Kindly contact [Microchip Local Sales]() to get access to actual libraries. You can still use ```pic32mk_mcf_zsmt_firmware.hex``` for PIC32MK MCF devices, and  ```pic32mk_mcm_zsmt_firmware```for PIC32MK MCM devices to evaluate the project.

**Note**: Evaluation of ```pic32mk_mcm_zsmt_firmware``` for PIC32MK MCM requires PIM modification. Remove the external op-amp circuitary for current measurement. Contact us in case of queries.
