# PMSM FOC using Quadrature Encoder

This example application shows how to control the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) with Quadrature Encoder based Field Oriented Control (FOC) on a PIC32MK Micro-controller. 

## Description

Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) is controlled using Field Oriented Control (FOC). Rotor position and speed is determined using Quadrature Encoder. Motor start/stop operation is controlled by the switch and motor speed can be changed by the on-board potentiometer. Waveforms and variables can be monitored runtime using X2CScope. 

Key features enabled in this project are:

- Dual shunt current measurement
- Speed control loop
- Field weakening


## MHC Project Configurations

- **ADCHS Peripheral**: 

    The ADCHS is used to measure analog quantities. Four channels are used to measure the Phase Current U, the Phase Current V, the DC Bus Voltage and the Potentiometer. Conversion is triggered at the PWM (zero match + offset of the switch delay) 
- **MCPWM Peripheral**: 

    This peripheral is used to generated three phase synchronous PWM waveforms. Fault functionality is also enabled to switch off the output waveforms asynchronously.
- **QEI Peripheral**:

    This peripheral is used to decode the rotor position and speed from quadrature encoder signals.    
- **X2CScope**: 

    This component adds X2C scope protocol code. This uses UART to communicate to the host PC. X2CScope allows user to monitor variables runtime.
- **UART Peripheral**: 

    The UART is used for X2CScope communication to observe graphs and variable values in run time 

## Control Algorithm

This section briefly explains the FOC control algorithm, software design and implementation. Refer to [Application note AN2520](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/AppNotes/Sensorless-FOC-For-PMSM-using-PLL-Estimator-FW-AN-DS00002520C.pdf) for the PLL estimator based sensor-less FOC technique in detail. 

Field Oriented Control is the technique used to achieve the decoupled control of torque and flux. This is done by transforming the stator current quantities (phase currents) from stationary reference frame to torque and flux producing currents components in rotating reference frame using mathematical transformations. The Field Oriented Control is done as follows: 

1. Measure the motor phase currents. 
2. Transform them into the two phase system (a, b) using the Clarke transformation. 
3. Calculate the rotor position angle. 
4. Transform stator currents into the d,q-coordinate system using the Park transformation. 
5. The stator current torque (iq) and flux (id) producing components are controlled separately by the controllers. 
6. The output stator voltage space vector is transformed back from the d,q-coordinate system into the two phase system fixed with the stator by the Inverse Park transformation. 
7. Using the space vector modulation, the three-phase output voltage is generated. 

**Quadrature Encoder based FOC** :

Rotor position and speed are determined using quadrature encoder sensor. TC peripheral is configured in QDEC position mode. It counts
the decoded quadrature pulses which is the position of the rotor. In this example, counter is a free running counter and software logic is implemented to get the exact angular position from the count. Speed is calculated by measuring the number of quadrature pulses in a fixed time interval. 

Rotor is first aligned to a known position by exiciting either d-axis or q-axis. And then motor is controlled in a closed loop there after. 

The following block diagram shows the software realization of the FOC algorithm.

## Software Design

## Software Design

-   PMSM FOC Control loop is implemented in the ADC result ready interrupt. Refer to the flow chart given below. 
-   ADC channel conversion is triggered by the PWM overflow/zero match event. This trigger point could vary based on the current measurement techniques and MCU PWM IP implementation.
-   ADC interrupt frequency depends on the PWM frequency.
-   Slow loop task is executed 10 times slower than ADC interrupt. Polling of switches for user inputs and reference speed calculation is handled in the slow loop task.

### State Machine

-   **Idle**:

In this state, control waits for the switch press. 

-   **Flying Start**:

In this state, the control algorithm detects if the motor is freewheeling. If the motor's freewheeling speed is above the minimum Flying Start Detect speed and in the same direction as the command direction, the state machine directly enters in to "Closed Loop" state. 

However, if the freewheeling speed is less than minimum Flying Start Detect speed, the control algorithm attempts to passive brake the motor by applying pulses of "NUll Vectors". 

If the freewheeling speed is more than the minimum Flying Start Detect speed but in the opposite direction of the command direction, the control algorithm attempts to active brake the motor by regenerative braking (if enabled). Once the motor speed falls below the minimum Flying Start Detect speed, the control algorithm attempts to passive brake the motor by applying pulses of "NUll Vectors". 

-   **Field Alignment**:

Rotor is aligned to known position at D-axis or Q-axis by applying a pre-defined value of the current for a pre-defined length of time. The magnitude of the current and the length of the time for which it is applied depends upon the electrical and mechanical time constant of the PMSM motor drive. Electrical time constant of the motor is a function of R and L values of the motor windings, whereas the mechanical time constant of the motor drive is primarily a function of the static load on the motor shaft. 

-   **Open Loop**:

This state is applicable to sensorless position feedback methods. In this state, the speed of the PMSM motor is gradually ramped up using an open loop control. During this mode, the rotor angle is derived from the asserted open loop speed reference. This derived rotor angle would be lagging from the actual rotor angle. The speed is ramped up linearly to a minimum value required for the PLL estimator to estimate the electrical speed of the PMSM motor with sufficient accuracy. Rotor angle information is obtained by integrating the estimated electrical speed of the motor. 

-   **Closing Loop**:

In this state, control waits for stabilization time. 

-   **Closed Loop**:

Control switched to closed loop and rotor angle is obtained from the configured position feedback method.
