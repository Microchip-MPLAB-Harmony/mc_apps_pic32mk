# Sensorless FOC on PMSM using Sliding mode observer

This example application shows how to control the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) with sliding mode observer based Field Oriented Control (FOC) on a PIC32MK Micro-controller. 

## Description

Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) is controlled using Field Oriented Control (FOC). Rotor position and speed is determined using sliding mode observer. Motor start/stop operation is controlled by the switch and motor speed can be changed by the on-board potentiometer. Waveforms and variables can be monitored runtime using X2CScope.
