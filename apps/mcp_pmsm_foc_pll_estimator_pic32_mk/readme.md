# PMSM FOC using PLL Estimator

This example application shows how to control the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) with PLL estimator based Field Oriented Control (FOC) on a PIC32MK Micro-controller.

## Description

Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) is controlled using Field Oriented Control (FOC). Rotor position and speed is determined using PLL based estimator. Motor start/stop operation is controlled by the switch and motor speed can be changed by the on-board potentiometer. Waveforms and variables can be monitored runtime using X2CScope.
