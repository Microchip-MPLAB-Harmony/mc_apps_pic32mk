# PMSM FOC using PLL Estimator

This example application shows how to control the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) with Quadrature Encoder based Field Oriented Control (FOC) on a PIC32MK Micro-controller. 

## Description

Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) is controlled using Field Oriented Control (FOC). Rotor position and speed is determined using Quadrature Encoder. Motor start/stop operation is controlled by the switch and motor speed can be changed by the on-board potentiometer. Waveforms and variables can be monitored runtime using X2CScope. 

Key features enabled in this project are:

- Dual shunt current measurement
- Speed control loop


## MHC Project Configurations

![MHC Project Graph](images/project_graph.jpg)

- **PMSM_FOC**: 

    This component configures FOC algorithm parameters, motor parameters and motor control board parameters. It connects to underlying peripheral libraries ADCHS and MCPWM. This components auto configures ADC channels and PWM channels as per PMSM_FOC component configurations. 
- **ADCHS Peripheral**: 

    The ADCHS is used to measure analog quantities. Four channels are used to measure the Phase Current U, the Phase Current V, the DC Bus Voltage and the Potentiometer. Conversion is triggered at the PWM (zero match + offset of the switch delay) 
- **MCPWM Peripheral**: 

    This peripheral is used to generated three phase synchronous PWM waveforms. Fault functionality is also enabled to switch off the output waveforms asynchronously.
- **X2CScope**: 

    This component adds X2C scope protocol code. This uses UART to communicate to the host PC. X2CScope allows user to monitor variables runtime.
- **UART Peripheral**: 

    The UART is used for X2CScope communication to observe graphs and variable values in run time
